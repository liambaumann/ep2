// This class represents a polynomial. A polynomial is a sum of multiple monomials (class 'Monomial'),
// such as 3*x^1 + -1*x^2 + 1*x^5.
// 'Polynomial' uses a binary search tree to store its monomials. The degree of the monomial is the key.
// A specific degree exists at most once in the polynomial.
// TODO: define further classes for the implementation of the binary search tree, if needed
