Optimized solutions for exams of the EP2 course at the Vienna University of Technology from 2018 to 2020.

The EP2 course primarily consists of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions, which are similar in difficulty to LeetCode's medium-level questions.

My solution for the latest exam (2021) received all points.
