My solutions to all previous exams from the [Introduction to Programming 2](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=8347&dsrid=442&courseNr=185A92) course at the Vienna University of Technology between the years 2018-2020.

Every single solution has been optimized and the maximum amount of points were achieved in the most recent exam.
